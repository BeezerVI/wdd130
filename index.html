            <p>Hi, my name is Hyrum. I'm 16, and I live in Alberta, Canada, for now. My family and I like to travel a lot around the world. We have been to Dubai and to volcanoes, etc. Uh, what else about me? Oh yeah, I like programming. That is really fun. I started on Scratch when I was a kid, but now I'm gradually going on Unity. I also do pixel art on Aseprite. Though I would not call myself an expert, I make good art. One of the cool things about me, is I have amazing friends worldwide! We go to some unique places every year, and travelling has become a big part of our family. I have four brothers; one is older than me and has left on his mission, and the three younger ones ranging from ages 14 to 9 are just chilling with me. Some things I like to do are D&D, Minecraft, RainWorld/SlugCat/Gourmand, reading the Book of Mormon (you should read this book; it's really good XD), and hanging out with my friends.</p>
